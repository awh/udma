<h1 align=center>Diablo II Item Format</h1>

<h3 align=center>for Diablo II v1.09 and the Diablo II Expansion
Set: Lord of Destruction</h3>

<br>
<p align=center>Updated November 13, 2003<br>
<i><accessed> visitors since <accessed since></i></p>

<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>Thanks for showing an interest in my Diablo II Item Format
page.&nbsp; While you're browsing, be sure to check out the preview of
my <a href="DiabloIIv1.09_Editor.shtml">game editor</a> for
unix+Motif.&nbsp; I currently have the item editor in development!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Having searched the web, I found very few references to the Diablo
II <tt>.d2s</tt> file format, and most of them covered the old
(pre-1.08) version.&nbsp; Diablo II v1.09 has significantly changed
the file format.&nbsp; I have started another page which details <a
href="DiabloIIv1.09_File_Format.shtml">the layout of the major parts of
the <tt>.d2s</tt> file.</a>&nbsp; This document focuses specifically
on the item structure -- all those pieces of the file tagged "JM".</p>

<p>Rather than describe everything in terms of byte offsets, I'm going
to define the layout as a series of variable-length bit fields.&nbsp;
This is a critical part of the item format, because the position of
many of the fields can change depending on what comes before it.&nbsp;
If I say a certain value is a 3-bit field starting at bit position
150, for example, this translates to bits 6 and 7 of the byte 18 and
bit 0 of byte 19 in the data structure.&nbsp; You can read an
arbitrary bit field programatically using the following code (in
C):</p>

<pre>#define read_bits(start,size) \
    ((*((unsigned long *) &amp;data[(start) / 8])
      >> ((start) &amp; 7)) &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; (size)) - 1))</pre>

<h2>Item List Header</h2>

<p>An item list begins with the following simple header:</p>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<th WIDTH="10%">Byte Position</th>
<th WIDTH="10%">Size</th><th>Contents</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>0</td>
<td align=center>2 <tt>char</tt>s</td>
<td>Identifier string "JM" { 0x4a, 0x4d }</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>2</td>
<td align=center>16 bits</td>
<td>The number of items your character has.&nbsp; This does not
include gems or jewels which have been glued into socketed items.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Your item list ends with another 4-byte structure similar to the
above, except the second field is zero (i.e.,
{&nbsp;0x4a,&nbsp;0x4d,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0&nbsp;}).</p>

<p>In the Expansion Set, your hireling has his/her own item
list.&nbsp; This list is separated from yours by the 2-character
identifier "jf".&nbsp; This is followed by an item list header for the
hireling, and then his/her items.&nbsp; The second item list is
<i>not</i> terminated with the same 4-byte structure as the first;
instead, it is followed by the 2-character identifier "kf".</p>

<h2>Item Structure part 1: Simple Items</h2>

<p>There are still many fields in the item structure which I haven't
figured out yet, but I'll leave placeholders for them in case I find
out what they mean in the future.&nbsp; All sizes are in bits unless
otherwise specified.</p>

<p>Following the end of the name, the rest of the final byte will be
padded with 0's if necessary, and the Player Ear structure ends
there.</p>

<h2>Item Structure part 2: Extended Items</h2>

<p>By "extended items" I mean any items which are not <a
href="#37">simple.</a>&nbsp; Simple items are those which need no
further information than that given above--such as gems, potions, and
small quest items--and their structure length is fixed at 14
bytes.&nbsp; Everything else has an extended structure with a possibly
variable length set of bit fields.&nbsp; First, I'll describe the part
of the structure that appears to be the same for all extended
items.&nbsp; From that point on, there will be no more "bit
positions"; only "this field follows that field, if it exists".<p>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<th WIDTH="10%">Bit Position</th>
<th WIDTH="10%">Size</th><th>Contents</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>111</td><td align=center>32</td>
<td>Unique identifier.&nbsp; Diablo II randomly generates a value for
this field in order to discourage cheaters from "duping" items.&nbsp;
Supposedly, if it detects more than one extended item with the same
unique ID, it will delete the duplicates.&nbsp; (It hasn't done that
for me in single player mode, though.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>143</td><td align=center>7</td>
<td><div>This appears to be the item's level; i.e., the level with
which the item was created (or 'dropped').&nbsp; The item level is

area you're in if found in a chest, or, in rare cases, your characters
level.&nbsp; The item level determines what modifiers are allowed on
the item.</div>

<h3><a name="personalized">Personalization</a></h3>

<p>The following segment is present if and only if the item is

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<h2><a name="specific">Item Structure part 3: Item-Specific
Data</a></h2>

<p>The presence of the following fields depends on the item
type.&nbsp; Fields which are present will be stored in the order
shown.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is no means of telling which fields
are present from the item data itself; you need to look up the <a
href="#76">item type</a> in a table to figure out whether it is a
weapon, armor, or stack, and read the fields accordingly.</p>

<h3>Armor: Defense Rating</h3>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<th WIDTH="20%">Size</th><th>Contents</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>10</td>
<td>Defense value +&nbsp;10.&nbsp; i.e., a defense rating of 23 would
be stored in this field as 33; thus the maximum defense value you can
store is 1013 (although I haven't tried it).&nbsp; Note that this is
the base defense rating, before applying any magical enhancements
(i.e., the number shown in white).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Armor and Weapons: Durability</h3>

<p>Even though stacked weapons don't show any durability rating in the
game, they still have two 8-bit fields in the same spot.&nbsp; This
includes bombs (exploding and gas potions).&nbsp; The values in such
cases are very small, so I'm not sure what they mean.</p>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<th WIDTH="20%">Size</th><th>Contents</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>8</td>
<td>Maximum Durability.&nbsp; Note that this is the base durability,
before applying any magical enhancements (i.e., the number shown in
white).<br>
<i>Note: </i>I've found an indestructable item, and it appears that in
such a case the maximum durability field is zero!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>8</td>
<td>Current Durability.&nbsp; This may be greater than the maximum
durability if the item is magically enhanced.<br>
<i>Note: </i>I've found an indestructable item, and it appears that in
such a case the current durability field is missing!</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3><a name="sockets">Armor and (non-stacked) Weapons: Sockets</a></h3>

<p>The following field is present if and only if the item is socketed
(i.e., <a href="#27">bit 27</a> is set).</p>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<th WIDTH="20%">Size</th><th colspan=2>Contents</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>4</td><td>Number of sockets<br>
<i>Note that even though this field is 4 bits wide, each item type has
a built-in upper limit to the total number of sockets.&nbsp; This
limit is built into the game.&nbsp; The most I've
ever seen is 6 for, e.g., a gothic axe.</td>
<td width=179><img src="images/diablo2/Socketed_Mask.jpg" width=179

<h3>Tomes:</h3>

<p>Tomes have an extra 5 bits inserted at this point.&nbsp; I have no
idea what purpose they serve.&nbsp; It looks like the value is 0 on
all of my tomes.</p>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<th WIDTH="20%">Size</th><th>Contents</th>

<tr>
<td align=center>5</td><td><i>unknown</i></td>

<h3>Stacked Weapons, Quivers, Keys, and Tomes: Quantity</h3>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<th WIDTH="20%">Size</th><th>Contents</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>9</td><td>Quantity</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="enhancements">Item Structure part 3: Magical
Enhancements</a></h2>

<h3>Item Structure part 2<sup>bis</sup>: <a
name="set_extended_data">Set Item Data Revisited</a></h3>

<p>Items which are part of a set have an additional 5 bits following
the item-specific data.</p>

<table BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<th WIDTH="20%">Size</th><th>Contents</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>5</td>
<td>This appears to be an indicator of how many lists of magic
properties follows.&nbsp; The first list are the properties the item
has if you do not have any other members of the set.&nbsp; Following
lists are applied once you equip other items in the set.&nbsp; The
value is 1 if there are two (total) property lists, or 3 if there are
three property lists.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Following the item-specific data are a variable number of variable
length bit fields describing any magical enhancements placed on the
item.&nbsp; Each property begins with a 9-bit identifier.&nbsp; An
identifier of <tt>0x1ff</tt> (all 1's) indicates the end of the
property list ... except in the event the item belongs to a set, in
which case there will be another one or two groups of magical
properties following, depending on whether the set item data (above)
is 1 or 3, respectively.&nbsp; Also, if an item has been given a <a
href="#42">Rune Word</a>, it appears that the Rune Word's properties
begin with a <tt>0x1ff</tt> identifier (presumably to set them apart
from the item's normal properties... but I need to examine more items
to be certain.)</p>

<p>Because the number of bits (and fields) after the 9-bit identifier
varies, I do not give a field width here.&nbsp; Instead, check my
<a href="DiabloIIv1.09_Magic_Properties.shtml">table of magic
properties</a> for field sizes.&nbsp; I'm sure it's not complete, but
it does have most of the common properties.</p>

<p>Following the last 9-bit value of 0x1ff, the rest of the final byte
will be padded with 0's if necessary, and the item structure ends
there.&nbsp; For example, if the item had 341 bits of data, the last
(43<sup>rd</sup>) byte will be 0x1f.&nbsp; If the item had 248 bits of
data, the last (31<sup>st</sup>) byte will be 0xff.</p>
